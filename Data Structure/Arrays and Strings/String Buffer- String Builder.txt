StringBuffer / StringBuilder

Question: What is the running time of this code?

1 public String makeSentence(String[] words) {
2 StringBuffer sentence = new StringBuffer();
3 for (String w : words) sentence.append(w);
4 return sentence.toString();
5 }

Answer: 
O(n^2), where n is the number of letters in sentence. 
Here’s why: each time you append a string to sentence, you create a copy of sentence and run through all the letters in sentence to copy them over. 
If you have to iterate through up to n characters each time in the loop, and you’re looping at least n times, that gives you an O(n^2) run time. 
With StringBuffer (or StringBuilder) can help you avoid this problem.

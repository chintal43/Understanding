ArrayList (Dynamically Resizing Array):

An ArrayList, or a dynamically resizing array, is an array that resizes itself as needed while still providing O(1) access. 
A typical implementation is that when a vector is full, the array doubles in size. 
Each doubling takes O(n) time, but happens so rarely that its amortized time is still O(1).

1 public ArrayList<String> merge(String[] words, String[] more) {
2 ArrayList<String> sentence = new ArrayList<String>();
3 for (String w : words) sentence.add(w);
4 for (String w : more) sentence.add(w);
5 return sentence;
